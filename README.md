# Stock_Up
Stock Up is a web application that provides stock market data of every company listed on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ for the last 20 years. The application takes adavantage of the D3 API to present the data in intuitive and pragmatic way. We choose to use a multi-series line chart and a bivariate chat to display and compare the data in a pragmatic way. The multi-series line chart displays the daily average for multiple stocks to allow one to compare the trends of stocks over a period of time. The bivariate area chart was used to show the highs and lows of a particular stock in a format similar to a line graph in order to estimate the risk associated with a stock. 

The file with the code to create the website and display the graphs is located in Stock_Up.php, the stocks.sql is 1.55 GB so it is too large to upload.
