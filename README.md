Stock Up is a web application that provides stock market data of every company listed on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ for the last 20 years. The application takes adavantage of the D3 API to present the data in intuitive and pragmatic way. We choose to use a multi-series line chart and a bivariate chat to display and compare the data in a pragmatic way. A bivariate area chart was used to show the high and low of an item in a format similar to a line graph in order to estimate the risk associated with a stock. Built with php, css, html, and javascript at 2015 fall PennApps.
